Gallatin is a content filtering web proxy. It is currently in its infancy, but will damn sweet soon enough.

Special thanks to Brandon Johnson for all of his efforts in the UI.

==Developer notes==
To build:
1. Visual Studio 2010 with web developer and MVC3
2. Install Nuget (http://nuget.org/) which will automatically install dependent packages (NUnit, Moq, etc.) during the build
3. .NET 4.0



Thanks and enjoy,

Bill O'Neill
